# Mood-Detection-w-OpenCV

Mood detection is the process of identifying and understanding a person's current emotional state. It can be done through a variety of methods, but we will focus on Facial expression recognition. Facial expressions are one of the most important cues for understanding human emotions. Mood detection systems can use computer vision techniques to analyze facial features and identify specific expressions, such as happiness, sadness, fear and anger. This project detects emotions with accuracy in real-time using OpenCV and DeepFace.
